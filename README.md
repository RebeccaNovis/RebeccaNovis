Hi! I'm Rebecca Novis, a student at Boise State University in the Games, Interactive Media, and Mobile Technology (GIMM) major. I have experience working in Unity for a variety of projects, including 2D, 3D, and VR projects. I’m also proficient in some Adobe products, including Photoshop and Premiere Pro. I love working on projects that require me to think creatively and that push my skill set. I am most interested in game development, but I am also enthusicatic about web development.
